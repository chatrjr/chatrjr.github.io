# chatrjr.name 

My personal site. Growing as I need it to grow and organized by version. You can check out the code of previous versions by tag.

## v1.0.0 (Seed)

Initial design. Intentionally made skeletal. Lacks a navigation bar as it wasn't needed. Just the main page and posts with a few contact links and a link to the feed.
