    <p>I&rsquo;ve been flitting around the tech world like a mad hummingbird for a while. Most of my work is web related, but I feed a broader interest in programming and systems. A curiosity about what I use every day boiled over into action with an internship as the starting pistol. And hell, I just get a lot of joy out of experimental play.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ll most often find me reading for knowledge or pleasure. Being somewhat severely introverted, I&rsquo;ve also used it to shield my personal space. Video games account for a good chunk of my time as well. I&rsquo;ve played probably too many Japanese and western RPGs, enjoy a good puzzle, and I&rsquo;ve been a 2D fighter since the SNES.</p>
    <p>My humble home on the internet is a scratchpad of my rough and finished ideas and projects. Finished in the sense that I&rsquo;ve stopped modifying them. I&rsquo;m unapologetic about how often I go off on tangents to cement my understanding or pick at specific problems. You can expect a <strong>lot</strong> of works-in-progress, self-correction, and rather frequent rejection of my outmoded ideas. Sometimes all at once.</p>
