    <p>I've been flitting around the tech world like a mad hummingbird for a while. Most of my work is web related, but I've also grown an interest in systems development. My dive into the field was motivated by a hunger for deeper understanding of what I use every day. Hell, it's just fun to play and bring ideas to life.</p>
    <p>I pass my time with books, and I've been reading for almost as long as I've known how to talk. I'm heavily introverted, so reading was one of the few socially acceptable ways to expand my bubble of personal space in public. My other major hobby is gaming. I've played what is certainly too many Japanese and western RPGs. And I've been a 2D fighter since the SNES.</p>
    <p>My humble little home on the internet is a scratchpad of my rough and finished ideas and projects. I'm an unapologetic experimenter. What I can't refine, I throw away. Expect a <strong>lot</strong> of works-in-progress and flips of opinion.</p>
