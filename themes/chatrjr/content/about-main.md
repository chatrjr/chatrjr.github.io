An internship a few years ago kicked off a deep curiosity in technology. I showed up for the web, stayed for the programming. I develop on Linux Mint, in Sublime Text and Vim, and spend intimate amounts of time with JavaScript on the front and backend.

I'm incredibly fascinated by programming languages as tools and have difficulty becoming attached to just one. I've fiddled with Ruby and Python just enough to be dangerous, and now I'm beginning a long dive into the functional programming pool with Haskell and flirting with JavaScript's own functional capabilities.

This is a scratchpad of my ideas in varied states of completion. Complete in the sense that I&rsquo;ve stopped fiddling with them. You'll find works in progress and occasional shotgun blasts to my own feet. If you want laser focus on just a few topics in technology, this probably won't be your cup of tea. This is my brain, and you're just along for the ride.
