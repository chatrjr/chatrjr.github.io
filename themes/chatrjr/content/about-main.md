I&rsquo;ve been flitting around the tech world for a while. Most of my work is web related, but I feed a broader interest in programming and. An internship was the starting pistol for what would become a deep curiosity in technology. And hell, I just get a lot of joy out of experimental play.

You&rsquo;ll most often find me reading for knowledge or pleasure. Video games account for a good chunk of my time as well. I&rsquo;ve played probably too many Japanese and western RPGs, enjoy a good puzzle, and I&rsquo;ve been a 2D fighter since the SNES.

This is a scratchpad of my rough and finished ideas. Finished in the sense that I&rsquo;ve stopped fiddling with them. Expect tons of works in progress and occasional shotgun blasts to the feet.
