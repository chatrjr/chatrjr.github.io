- The Tales of series is my favorite game franchise. Kingdom Hearts is a close second.
- I will probably never get sick of lasagna. Especially my late grandma's lasagna.
- I've watched FLCL more times than I can count.
- Running is my favorite activity once the snow melts (not so much before).
- I've poured enough hours into Devil May Cry 3 to max out the game clock four times.
- Guilty Gear XX #Reload is basically the best fighting game ever.
- I still main Marth in Smash Bros.
- Big fan of The Dresden Files.
