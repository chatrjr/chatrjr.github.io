I do most of my tinkering on the web at [CodePen][codepen] and [JSFiddle][jsfiddle]. My source code is hosted at [Github][source] and maintained privately on BitBucket.

You can get [the source of this site][site-repo] and details about its creation and growth.

Additionally, the typography is set in: [Oswald][font-hero], [Roboto Condensed][font-headings], and [Roboto][font-body] for headlines and body copy, [Fira Mono][font-code] for code.

If you like my stuff and want to work with me, or you just want to say hello, you can send an email to [chatmanrjr@gmail.com][my-mail]. You can also subscribe to post updates (however sporadic) [via the feed][feed].
