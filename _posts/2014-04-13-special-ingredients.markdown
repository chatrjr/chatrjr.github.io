excerpt: "A response to Jamie Kosoy's Pastry Box Project post: The Beautiful Default. Ready-made frameworks and UI libraries are often blamed for the homogeny of modern web design, but I think it has more to do with how they're used."

Jamie's post points out [the dynamic of bespoke vs. factory][PBP] within modern web design. While I agree there's an epidemic of sameness, it is---at the very least---beautiful sameness. Twitter Bootstrap, Zurb Foundation, Pure, and the like are gorgeous pieces of design out of the box, but that's not why they exist. Frameworks and libraries are ingredients.

## Boxed Macaroni & Cheese

Jamie used a wonderful analogy to highlight the problem with the ubiquity of frameworks, and I'll take it even further.

> It’s like cooking boxed macaroni & cheese: It might be faster to eating dinner but you’ll never be wowed by the result.

He's right. If you must use a framework, make it your own. Even Bootstrap has evolved to encourage customization from the onset. Using Bootstrap as-is will net you a passable design, but there's so much more to be done. If you go by the instructions on the back of a box of KRAFT Macaroni & Cheese, then it's still __KRAFT__ Macaroni and Cheese. Trademark and all. The senses will recognize the taste, texture, and even sound as KRAFT.

### ...With Fixin's

Add in some ground beef, a bit of pepper, and some vegetables. Now the mac and cheese is not the meal, but a base for your own dish. If your dish is especially ambitious, no one other than someone with an especially developed sense of taste will detect the KRAFT in it. Now it's yours.

## When You Can't be Bothered to Cook

Of course, that doesn't explain the sameness phenomenon. However, neither does laziness or ignorance, as you could argue. From what I've observed, the reasons could be any of the following.

### Inability

Let's face it, not everyone can cook. Dressing up some boxed food allows some to feel like they can, and also make a meal for themselves or family that won't be tossed in the trash. The strength of Bootstrap, Foundation, and such is allowance: they __allow developers lacking design sense__ to serve up an attractive UI to complement solid functionality. They allow businesses or fledgling companies to hit the ground running.

As much as I cringe at how readily I can recognize when a framework has been slapped on, I can empathize. Not every founder can get Milton Glaser. And not every kitchen can get Gordon Ramsay.

### Okay, Ignorance

Though ignorance in the sense of not knowing, rather than refusing to know. A developer who is ignorant of design can use a framework to explore concepts and implement ideas within a UI that won't make the eyes bleed. Personally, I think every developer can benefit from understanding even just the principles of design (I sure did), but that's a matter for a future post.

### Reliability

__This__ is the point of frameworks. This is likely why Jamie uses them. Mature frameworks, libraries, and boilerplates have thousands of hours of community expertise behind them. Using one is like standing on the shoulders of giants.

Even I'm more likely to trust HTML5 Boilerplate over my own memory. Any sliver of code you pull from them will be fire-forged and battle-tested. This is why I also believe more time should be spent maintaining and expanding mature tools over rolling our own.

Not to stifle the spirit of experimentation in the slightest.

## Nothing Like a Home-Cooked Meal

My dad makes this baked mac & cheese from scratch that will knock you off your feet. This is the other side of blindly adapting frameworks, and it illustrates well Jamie's call to action.

> I guess I’m begging you, dear reader, to try something more bespoke next time. Put away the boxed food, break out the fry pans and make something a little unique… even overcooked or a little burnt there’s flavor in the character.

My dad insists on a certain type of macaroni; he insists on a certain cheeses. And he's very particular about the way it's cooked. Hovers over it, even. And it takes an hour or two to bake. You can tell when he cares about what he's cooking. The smoke detector will let you know when he doesn't.

Differences in personalities mean that nothing we cook will taste the same when someone else cooks it. Even if it's the same dish. Our taste lives in homemade meals. 

When my dad cooks spaghetti, for example, the sauce will invariably be a bit salty. When my mom makes it, the noodles are softer and the sauce is a little sweet. When I make it, you're dealing with slightly firm noodles and a savory sauce. And this is because of the ingredients we prefer to use, the method we choose to cook, and our own preferred flavors.

I would also like to see more home-cooked meals.
