## Ready, Set, ...Wait.

Consider this: you're a developer with a bit of experience. You've learned and explored your first programming language (often Ruby, Python, or---for the ballsy---C). You know the conventions and idioms, and it feels like second nature.

Congratulations, learning your next will be hell.

Your intimate connection with your first language will do its best to sabotage your budding relationship with your second language. You may going from a C-derivative to another one, but you're not safe either.

As you grow and realize languages are tools for solving problems, learning your third, fourth, and even fifth languages won't be as difficult. Exposing yourself to more methods and paradigms reveals the commonality among them. **Languages themselves become extensions of universal concepts**.

Today, we're not here for the future. We're here for the present of you being fired up to learn a second language, and the dragons you'll encounter. Especially if you're switching paradigms.

## The Scout Rule

Preparation is key to your second language (and beyond). As developers, we stand on shoulders that break the forest canopy. We can leverage these resources in our continued learning.

### You, the Enemy

You may not notice right away, but your first language set the tone for how you relate to programming as a whole. After a while of Ruby, you begin to think about programs like a Rubyist. After a while of JavaScript, you begin thinking in JavaScript. The idioms and conventions of your first language will paint your understanding of the second. Not always for the better.

You'll be tempted to learn the similarities of your second language and simply port your understanding and methods there. **Fight this urge**: you'll lose out on the richness of going native.

The impact of learning a second language and a new way of thinking about programs is diminished if you only adapt the way you already think. For maximum benefit, **empty your cup**.

## Your Utility Belt

### Books

A few good books are invaluable when tilling fresh soil in a new language. Google is a great when looking for reputed books. If you have a colleague skilled in the language you want to learn, even better. That said, treat recommendations with skepticism. Investigate the books for yourself and see if they make sense to you.

<div class="post-body__note">
  For example, JS developers usually recommend Javascript: The Good Parts to beginners. A beginner to JS with a solid background in programming? Sure. A beginner to programming as a whole? Nope. Depends on what kind you are.
</div>

This mindset tends to inform recommendations:

> I wish I had it when I was starting.

Suggestions in this vein come from what we know *now*, not what we *didn't* know then.

> What do I need to understand a language as a beginner? Will this resource also set a good foundation for using its best features?

Scrutinize all book suggestions under that lens. Think about what you already know, what you want to know, and what you need to know. **Let that guide your search for resources to learn your second language.**.

#### About Blogs

Blogs aren't fit (most of the time) for *introductory* resources. Tutorials don't provide a generalized view. They highlight specific use cases and tools. Bookmark them for later when you understand more about your language.

Blog posts (including mine) often fall victim to a "as you know" mode of thought and make certain assumptions. And it's not easy to avoid these since we *all* form our own mental models as we become more knowledgeable in a topic. Part of being a good teacher is bridging these unconscious gaps so **your students develop their own connections**. Experts in a given field see more because they've *seen* more.

For books and blogs alike: expose yourself to as many forms of the same idea as you can if you don't understand right away. The way one author explains a concept may not click, but I bet there's another author who nails it for you.

### Practice Your New Language

Of course, knowledge that's never used is fruit that rots on the branch. You're skilled with your first language, but your second one demands a bit of unlearning. Again, even C-derivatives are not cut the same way. JavaScript is a great example. You can write it like C if you want, but you'd lose out on what makes it JavaScript.

Switching paradigms from imperative to functional or functional to logic means you have to diligently monitor yourself for your habits creeping into your learning.

#### Deliberate Practice

The best way to solidify new knowledge is to put it on trial. Some excellent services for practicing your skills are [Exercism][exercism] and [Codewars][codewars]. I love these services because they fulfill a crucial requirement for retention of knowledge: repetition and an instant feedback loop through testing your solutions.

We also can't neglect the celebrated art of just trying shit out. A great way to discover what a language excels at as a tool is to revisit a familiar problem and think about how your second language *feels* as you work to solve it.

Using your tools is how you find out if they're suited for the problem at hand. The more tools you explore, the better you can discern which is the right one for the job. The main benefit of continued learning as a developer: you begin to understand that not every problem is a nail and avoid unfortunate scenarios of welding with a hammer.

## Safety Nets

### Linters and Compilers

Do research about your second programming language before you learn it. Identify good syntax and style linters and how to enable all compiler warnings. Yes, *all* of them. **Cultivate good habits before you pick up bad ones**. Learning a language with the right linter and interpreter/compiler configuration is setting the phaser to stun. These guards in place, you'll spend time learning *how* it works rather than making it work.

### Version Control

A version control system isn't just a great way to monitor your progress, it facilitates experimentation and play. Check in your commits often and branch your ideas. The beauty of of Git, SVN, and others: no matter how badly you break something, order is just a `reset` or `revert` away. You're only truly screwed if you're *not* using version control.

### Documentation

Your programming language, unless it's esoteric or experimental (sometimes even then), has documentation. See if your wheel has already been invented. **Consult the docs**. When you're not sure what a method does, consult the docs. When you want in-depth information about a given feature of your language, consult the docs.

### Community

Look into the community. Find project or company coding style guides. It's one more thing to keep in your head as you learn, but seeing how a language is used by its primary users gets you in the mind for writing code **others can read and use**.

Immerse yourself before you start, and you'll know what to expect. If you want to learn Ruby, **learn to think like a Rubyist**. When you encounter problems, this knowledge will help you find a solution with your language *as* your language.

## Go Forth

This guide is an exercise in hindsight. I wish I had it the first time I tried learning Haskell. If I had been able to break the preconceptions about programming that writing JavaScript instilled, I would have had an easier time. If I had practiced Haskell more, read the docs, and observed the community for how Haskellers think and write Haskell, I wouldn't have burned so much rubber while figuring it out.

Success in learning your second language depends on how willing you are shelve the assumptions your first created about programs. **Dig into the domain you love, but knowing others generates the seismic force that breaks new ground**.

## A Final Note

That said, it's possible you're like me on that first approach and not quite ready for your second language or paradigm. I'll tell you what I should have told myself then: no pressure.

Acknowledge where you are as a developer right now. **Don't accept it**. Keep learning about programming and the art of code. Expose yourself to more problems. Develop your pattern recognition. Return to the language that burned you, and know you can take the heat.
